"""What is always in the picture, per camera, so summaries and tags follow what happened.

Live 2026-11-08 Driveway: cars passing on the road were summarised as "Red car parked in
driveway" and every event got a "car" tag, because the model describes the parked car in a whole
frame. Nothing in the AI Key does this: no firmware (2.2.8 ui-vlm-agent app.py) or Protect code
keeps a memory of the scene, so this is new behaviour, off unless DIYKEY_SCENE_MEMORY=1. What
Protect receives keeps its existing format, the description string and the whole-frame tags.

Learning happens once per recognizeKeyFrames event, from RamTagger.detect() boxes on that event's
frames. Each object is stored with its box (0..1000) and a fingerprint: OSNet for people,
CLIP for everything else. An object becomes:

  stationary  seen in the same spot in N events over a minimum time span (DIYKEY_SCENE_*).
              Vehicles need box IoU and fingerprint to match and last until they move. Animals
              and people match more loosely, weighting appearance, and expire when unseen.
  fixture     same spot and same look for 7 days (statues and posters detected as people).
              Ignored, and dropped silently the moment its look changes.

Things this module does beyond the rules, each to stop a specific false result:
  - Fingerprints are kept per lighting mode (colour day / greyscale IR). CLIP puts a night crop
    far from the same object by day (see CLAUDE.md "Traps"), so comparing across modes would
    report every parked car as replaced at dusk. An object not yet seen in this mode matches on
    a strict box alone and its fingerprint for the mode is added.
  - In an event with several frames, something seen in only one or two of them is not stationary
    evidence: that is what a passing car looks like.
  - A vehicle or animal the detector misses is looked for by fingerprinting its spot before it is
    counted missing, so one detector miss at 320 px does not report a move. Not for people: OSNet
    gives high cosines on non-person crops, so an empty chair would look like the person.

An object overlapping the event's own trigger box is never stationary evidence, and its spot is
not "visible" for the missing rule.

Limits: it learns only from frames at events, so changes are noticed at the next event, and a
moved camera resets what is learned (the old objects are reported missing once).

Every public function catches its own errors, logs them and returns a neutral value: this module
must never stop tagging or the upload.
