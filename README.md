**A reverse-engineering / interoperability proof of concept that makes a stock
Orange Pi 5 Plus present itself to a real UniFi Protect console as genuine AI Key
hardware (device class `aiprocessors`, type `UP-AI-KEY`, sysid `0xa5f0`).**

**It speaks the vendor wire protocol only (UDP discovery, HTTPS adoption, the
mTLS `ucp4` WebSocket, on-demand AI task dispatch and result callbacks), with no
firmware modification, no controller database writes, and no Ubiquiti code or
binaries.**

</div>

> [!WARNING]
> Proof of concept, not production software. It runs discovery, an HTTPS
> adoption endpoint and the AI task plumbing, and expects a PostgreSQL instance
> for AI results. Use it only with hardware and a Protect console you own. It
> presents a synthetic device identity; do not run it on a network you do not
> control. See [Disclaimer](#disclaimer).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hutchx86/diy-key && cd diy-key

sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv openssl
python3 -m venv ~/diykey-venv && . ~/diykey-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r diykey/requirements.txt
# Optional, only for the features you enable:
# pip install -r diykey/requirements-clip.txt   # DIYKEY_CLIP
# pip install -r diykey/requirements-lpr.txt    # DIYKEY_LPR
# pip install -r diykey/requirements-vlm.txt    # DIYKEY_VLM=transformers

cd diykey
sudo ~/diykey-venv/bin/python run_all.py --iface <your-interface>
```

Then click **Adopt** on the `AI Key` device in Protect. For a reboot-surviving
systemd instance with a fixed identity:

```bash
cd diykey
sudo python3 core/instance_manager.py create main --parent-iface <your-interface>
journalctl -u diy-key-instance-main -f
```

PostgreSQL setup (needed for the console to deliver AI results), migration of an
already-adopted identity, and the component-level detail live in
[`diykey/README.md`](diykey/README.md) and `implementation.md` in the private
workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> **macOS:** DIY-Key runs on a Mac against Protect 7.3 with real Basic Understanding tags, Second
> Stage Verification, retroactive processing, Find Anything search (the AI Key's nl-search
> connection + CLIP ViT-L/14) and a simulated firmware update. Build, configure and run it from
> [`docs/macos.md`](docs/macos.md); open work is in [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Linux / Orange Pi:** the AI stages run on the deployed RK3588 runtime. Instance setup, the
> per-instance `diykey.env` for the detector/CLIP, and the current limits (CPU inference, shared
> PostgreSQL, no RKNN path yet) are in [`docs/linux.md`](docs/linux.md).

## At a glance

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **What** | Emulates the UniFi Protect AI Key device role |
| **Hardware** | Orange Pi 5 Plus (RK3588 NPU), verified live; any Linux host for the protocol stack |
| **Protocol / interface** | UBNT discovery UDP/10001; HTTPS :8080 adopt; mTLS WSS :7442 (`ucp4`); callbacks to console :7444; Postgres :5432; gRPC :50051 (stub) |
| **Language** | Python 3.11+ |
| **Status** | Proof of concept: adoption and the live RPC handshake verified against a real UNVR; face pipeline NPU-proven but not yet wired into dispatch |
| **License** | AGPL-3.0-or-later |

## How it works

```
Protect console                         DIY-Key (Orange Pi)
      │  UDP/10001 discovery (multicast)      │
      ├──────────────────────────────────────►│  stage1_discovery/beacon.py
      │  HTTPS :8080 GET /api/info            │
      │  HTTPS :8080 POST /api/adopt ────────►│  stage1_http/adopt_http.py
      │                                       │    └─ adopt_state.json (0600)
      │  mTLS WSS :7442 "ucp4" ◄─────────────►│  stage3_wss/ucp4_client.py
      │    getInfo / metrics / tasks          │    ├─ systemMetrics (RK3588 telemetry)
      │    recognizeKeyFrames / RequestAI     │    └─ result POSTs back to :7444
      │  PostgreSQL :5432 ◄───────────────────│  (console-owned schema + pgvector)
```

The device is an **AI Key**, not a camera: it never pulls RTSP video. The console
dispatches work on demand (a clip URL for `recognizeKeyFrames`, or a local
model-inference request for `RequestAI`), and the device reports results over the
console's internal API and/or Postgres. Identity is a persistent MAC/device-id
plus an EC P-256 client certificate whose fingerprint the console pins at
adoption; the token is single-use.

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `diykey/core/config.py` | One config/identity source (`diykey.cfg` + `DIYKEY_*`), iface/MAC/IP resolution, atomic state |
| `diykey/core/instance_manager.py` | One systemd unit per emulated device (macvlan or physical), reboot persistence |
| `diykey/stage1_discovery/beacon.py` | UBNT discovery responder (real TLV set/order) |
| `diykey/stage1_http/adopt_http.py` | HTTPS control API, adoption persistence, cert generation |
| `diykey/stage3_wss/ucp4_client.py` | Outbound mTLS `ucp4` client, RPC dispatch, task callbacks |
| `diykey/stage3_wss/system_stats.py` | RK3588 CPU/GPU/NPU/RAM metrics for `systemMetrics` |
| `diykey/stage4_modelserver/model_server.py` | `ui-infer-gateway`-shaped inference endpoint on :7788 |
| `diykey/stage2_grpc/` | Stub `ProtectAPI` gRPC server on :50051 (not yet confirmed dialed) |
| `diykey/stage5_faceid/` | RKNN face detection + embedding pipeline (NPU-proven, not wired) |

## Features

- Live-verified adoption flow: discovery → flat `/api/adopt` → mTLS `ucp4`.
- Exact AI-Key RPC set: `getInfo`, `networkStatus`, `changeUserPassword`,
  `systemMetrics`, `getTaskQueueInfo`, `recognizeKeyFrames`, `RequestAI`; unknown
  actions are acked and logged for capture.
- Tokenless reconnect with a pinned cert, single-use adoption tokens, and
  re-adoption watcher (readopt/unadopt forces a clean session).
- Real RK3588 telemetry (CPU, GPU, NPU, memory) and a flat `systemMetrics` shape.
- Task plumbing for RAM/reverification results, multipart `ram` upload and the
  console's `/internal/aiprocessors/*` callbacks.
- Shared config/state layer, per-instance systemd units, and 445 unit tests.
- Wired AI work in `stage3_wss/`: SFace face recognition, fast-alpr plates, GFPGAN
  enhancement, VLM summaries, OSNet re-ID and per-camera scene memory.
- Face detection (`RetinaFace_mobile320`) and embedding (`w600k_mbf`) running on
  the RK3588 NPU; see the limitation below before using the embeddings.

## Requirements

- Orange Pi 5 Plus (RK3588) for the verified path; the protocol stack runs on any
  Linux host. Root is needed for interface scoping/macvlan (the listeners are on
  unprivileged ports).
- Python 3.11+, `python3-venv`, `openssl`.
- Optional: Rockchip `rknn-toolkit-lite2` + `librknnrt` 2.3.2 for the face
  pipeline (`diykey/requirements.txt` explains the wheel).
- PostgreSQL 15 + `pgvector` for the console's AI-results channel.

## Install and usage

The full walkthrough (venv, generated bindings, PostgreSQL/pgvector, the macvlan
instance, and migrating an already-adopted identity without changing the pinned
cert) is in [`diykey/README.md`](diykey/README.md). The short version:

```bash
cd diykey
sudo python3 run_all.py --iface <iface> --hostname diy-key   # foreground
sudo python3 core/instance_manager.py list                  # instances + live IPs
```

The adopt token, TLS keypair and per-instance state live under
`diykey/stage1_http/` for a single instance, or `diykey/instances/<name>/` with the
manager. The key is mode 0600; never commit the state directory.

## Configuration

`diykey/diykey.cfg` holds `[identity]` (MAC, hostname, platform, sysid, firmware,
device-id, guid), `[network]`, `[console]` and `[logging]`. Every value has a
`DIYKEY_*` environment override and CLI flags; CLI wins, then env, then the file.
Do not change `device_id`/`guid`/MAC once a console has adopted the device, and
do not regenerate `server.crt`/`server.key` without un-adopting first; the
console pins the fingerprint.

## Verification

No hardware needed:

```bash
cd diykey && python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v   # 445 tests
```

Verified live on an Orange Pi 5 Plus against a real UNVR (2026-09-07): discovery,
adoption, the `ucp4` handshake and RPCs, and `recognizeKeyFrames`/`RequestAI`
placeholder results accepted (HTTP 200). The protocol facts are documented in the
private `protocol.md` (§1 discovery, §2 adoption, §3 ucp4, §5 inference contracts,
§6 Postgres, §7 face recognition, §7.1 face-DB embedding space).

Verified on the board since 2026-10-30: systemd instance, adoption, RAM tagging
and event delivery. Not yet verified: CLIP/Find Anything on the board, the gRPC
service being dialled by a console, and face results delivered end to end.

## Known limitations

- **Face embeddings are the wrong space for Protect.** Protect's face library is
  128-d SFace; `stage5_faceid/` uses 512-d MobileFaceNet. Detection/alignment are
  fine; the embeddings cannot be enrolled as-is (`protocol.md` §7.1).
- RAM tagging and second-stage verification need `DIYKEY_RAM_MODEL`; without it
  the result is a placeholder. LPR, face recognition, face enhancement and VLM
  descriptions are implemented but need their models and `DIYKEY_*` switch.
  Speech-to-text is not implemented.
- The gRPC `ProtectAPI` server is a stub; no console has been observed dialling it.
- Video-frame delivery is unsolved for the AI-Key path (on-demand clip fetch is
  the likely route; not implemented).
- Open work is tracked in [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md).

## Credits

Shared infrastructure is derived from the sibling **pi-port** project (same
author, AGPL-3.0-or-later): config/state, instance manager, discovery, adopt HTTP,
ucp4 framing/reconnect, run_all supervision and the test harness. The exact file
list and third-party attributions are in [`CREDITS.md`](CREDITS.md). Face models:
`RetinaFace_mobile320` from `airockchip/rknn_model_zoo`; `w600k_mbf` from
insightface's `buffalo_sc` pack, converted locally with `rknn-toolkit2`.

This is a proof of concept. It is not production software and comes with no

DHCP leases, self-signed certificates and device identities; misconfiguration

## Security

- The adopt token and TLS private key are written mode 0600 and are gitignored;
  keep the state directory out of version control and backups you share.
- The console does not validate the device certificate, and the device does not
  validate the console certificate (matching the real firmware); transport
  security here is identity pinning, not a trusted PKI.
- The emulator accepts the console's adoption POST without authentication, like
  the real device. Do not expose it to an untrusted network.
- The default PostgreSQL credentials are the console's own defaults and are only
  suitable for a lab.
